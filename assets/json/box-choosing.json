        "Do you believe that there are choices in life?\nThere are many people who lament the following:\nIf there only existed points in life where there were clear choices to make, we would be able to scrutinize those carefully and make decisions that would lead us to a better future.\n\nEvery time I hear people lament as such, I cast it off as a rather trivial worry.\nEven if you were given a clear choice, it wouldn't be meaningful at all, and there wouldn't be any such path to a better future.",
        "...Is this hard to understand?\nThen let's pretend that in front of you there are two strange boxes.\n\nIn other words, you have two clear choices.\nDo you open the red box, or the blue box?",
        "A lot of things would be uncertain even with that choice, wouldn't they?\n\nIf you don't have the option of opening neither, then your choice boils down to the natural impulse of opening the box that holds the better result for you.\nThen, after examining the shape and features of each, and pondering a great many things, you have to pick either the red or the blue.\n\n...If this was you, which box would you open?",
        "Red or blue?\n...If you were to go by their traditional meanings, then red would be a dangerous, threatening color.\nHowever, that doesn't automatically mean that it would be calm and relaxing inside the blue box, either.\nIn fact, it might even be that the colors are a trap, make you wary of the red box and have you open the blue.",
        "A trap?\n...Could it be the contents of the box aren't a reward, but rather a penalty?\n\nSee...? Now you're at a loss.\nYou're so conflicted over the choice between red and blue that you've started wishing there was an option to open neither and just leave.",
        "But there isn't. You have to open either the red box or the blue box.\nOh, I forgot to say this, but if you choose one box, the other will disappear.\nSo you'll never know the contents of box you don't open. I'll just put that that rule at the end there for you.",
        "Now. Why don't you choose?\nThe red box, or the blue box?\n\n...It's all right, you won't lose anything by picking either one. ...Come on now.",

        "So, what do you think in the end?\nIf you were given a second chance, would you try to open the other box?\n...But unfortunately, the chance to choose between the red box or the blue box has come and gone, never to be seen again.\nThe chance to change your selection will never come.",
