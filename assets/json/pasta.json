    "traps": "**sigh**\ntraps are not gay. I repeat, traps ARE NOT GAY. How idiotic do you have to be to think that they are? traps are probably even less gay than some women.\nI understand why some people MIGHT consider traps to be gay, but once thinking about it i don't know why people wouldn't change their mind. traps look like women. WOMEN ARE NOT GAY. IF YOU FUCK SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE A WOMEN, HOW IS THAT EVEN SLIGHTLY FUCKING GAY?\nI can kinda see why people think having a dick makes it gay, but the dick only makes up about 0.2% of the human body. if the rest of the body is feminine, that's 99.8% straight. let me repeat, 99.8% STRAIGHT, THAT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING STRAIGHT. THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE LESS THAN 99.8% FEMININE, YET PEOPLE DON'T CALL THEM GAY. If you wanna fuck a woman who looks manly as fuck, I'm not gonna call you gay, but you shouldnt call me gay for fucking traps either.\nIt makes no sense why people let a single penis ruin an entire sexual encounter, it's easy enough to ignore. Traps still have fuckable assholes, you don't need to fuck the pussy specifically. And if it's that much of a problem, just look away. He isn't gonna rub his dick on you or anything.\nThere are plenty of nice traps out there, and Im sure you'd get along well with them, but you choose not to because of something on them which takes up 0.2% of their body. It's nonsensical and stupid how worked up people get over something so small but completely ignore the rest of the body.\nIf you're worried about your friends knowing that you're fucking someone 0.2% masculine and 99.8% feminine, they don't need to find out. Believe it or not, traps can wear clothes too. They don't walk around with their dicks hanging out, they cover their dick with pants or skirts. Nobody has to find out that you're in a perfectly heterosexual relationship.",

    "rickandmorty": "My iq is 76 and I am currently failing my degree. Today I was in the bus and suddently I saw this guy watching Rick and Morty. The bus stopped and he got off, but those mere 10 seconds of visuals have left a stunning mark on me. I felt a lot smarter and decided I got to have a medical professional check this out, so the next day I went to get my iq tested again (at the same place that labelled me as 'mentally challenged' only one month before). They start showing me weird pictures and ask me to choose which is the next picture in the pattern. After I finish they start uploading my choices on their computer system and they tell me to wait in the lobby. In the ten minutes that I wait I invent string theory and emailed my work to my professor. Then, my results came back and apparently I got all of the questions right. The people running the place say that this never happened before and that their software has crashed when it tried to compute my iq. I have a big grin on my face at this point, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone. It was an email from my professor informing me that the scientific community is impressed with my work on string theory and that I have been nominated for a nobel prize. It turns out the university also decided to award my degree early. I highly suggest you watch Rick and Morty. If 10 seconds of graphics without audio had this effect on me, who knows what might happen if you watch all of the episodes? Perhaps you might even stop being a drain on society.",
